The AI engineer's trajectory involved an iterative process of feature development and critical bug fixing for the Aavana Greens CRM application, building upon an initial MVP. Initially, the focus was on UI stability,  errors, and  dependency issues. Subsequently, the engineer implemented significant features: multi-file uploads with camera capture, voice-to-text, robust role/department management, lead actions, a comprehensive catalog management system, and an overhaul of Face Check-in. Numerous JavaScript runtime and JSX compilation issues were identified and resolved. Recurring issues, particularly with Face Check-in and camera functionality, led to deeper investigations and refactorings, including separating camera logic into a dedicated component. Backend connectivity and API issues, such as 502 errors and failed to fetch tasks, were also addressed. The engineer performed comprehensive audits and addressed specific user-reported bugs, consistently updating the user on progress and validating fixes through screenshots and backend tests. The current phase involves a final comprehensive audit, with the notification system integration identified as the last remaining critical frontend issue.

-   Face Check-In has cross-device functionality.
-   Lead-Specific Camera features are enhanced and functional.
-   Workflow Authoring's Create New Workflow is fixed.
-   Aavana 2.0 Voice Integration is fully functional.
-   Sharing Features (WhatsApp/Email/Links) are implemented.
-   Project Types Management rendering errors are fixed.
-   Authentication System (JWT-based) is working.
-   AI Stack Integration (19 endpoints) is operational.

The final step of this audit involved a comprehensive frontend audit, which concluded that the application is 90% production-ready. The **only critical issue remaining** to be fixed in the frontend, as identified by the audit and the AI engineer, is the **NotificationSystem component not being integrated**.

The immediate task is to integrate the  component.
