The previous AI engineer initiated a complex transition for the Aavana Greens CRM. Initially, the CRM focused on core features with AI integration, but persistent UI regressions and API errors, particularly 502s from AI, led to a strategic pivot. The user explicitly requested the Digital Marketing Manager (DMM) module be extracted into a separate, autonomous application. The engineer is currently focused on building and deploying this new DMM microservice on the Emergent platform, including separate backend and frontend services, MongoDB Atlas, and SSO configuration. A critical setback is the corrupted  in the main CRM backend, which remains unaddressed. Latest efforts involved scaffolding DMM backend AI orchestration using GPT-5 beta, creating DMM frontend page shells, and confirming DMM backend functionality, though AI calls face budget limitations, prompting a query to the user.

<product_requirements>
The Aavana Greens CRM, a React, FastAPI, MongoDB application, required AI orchestration, a comprehensive Marketing Manager, upgraded Task Management, enhanced CRM features, and notifications with UI consistency and RBAC. The Marketing Manager was to offer autonomous analysis, approval-gated campaigns for various media (Reels, UGC, Influencers, Brand Content, Google Ads, Social, Email, WhatsApp), persistence, and continuous optimization. Explicitly, the Digital Marketing Manager (DMM) was requested as a 100% autonomous app, capable of independent data analysis for marketing strategies (AI influencer, UGC, brand promotion, media content, ads, social, email, WhatsApp) with user approval and customizable targeting. The AI must continuously optimize performance, always seeking approval.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture:** React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database.
- **AI Orchestration:** Centralized  (CRM) and new DMM backend AI integration using .
- **Persistence:** MongoDB collections (e.g., ), UUIDs for IDs.
- **Deployment:** Docker, Kubernetes (manifests), Emergent platform, GitHub integration.
- **Authentication:** JWT (HS256) for SSO deep-link.
- **Speech-to-Text (STT):** Google Cloud Speech-to-Text v2 (planned for CRM).

<current_work>
The immediate focus is on the new, isolated Digital Marketing Manager (DMM) application. The AI engineer has successfully scaffolded the DMM backend () by integrating AI orchestration with GPT-5 beta using the  library. Essential marketing CRUD endpoints are functional. Corresponding  files for both DMM backend and frontend have been created. On the frontend (), placeholder page components (, , , ) have been created under , along with a new  for API configuration and  for basic styling.

Backend testing confirmed that the marketing CRUD operations are working correctly. However, calls to the newly integrated AI endpoints are encountering a budget limitation with the Emergent LLM key. This issue is currently blocking further progress on AI-driven features. The CRM application's  remains corrupted, rendering its backend non-functional and is an outstanding critical issue.
