<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully initiated development for Aavana Greens' all-in-one business management system. The work progressed through phases, starting with a core CRM dashboard, followed by hybrid AI integration, and the implementation of ERP/HRMS functionalities. The development was iterative, with frequent user feedback leading to feature enhancements and bug fixes. Key challenges included UI state management, API timeouts due to LLM calls, and ensuring correct data flow. The engineer demonstrated an ability to integrate LLMs, handle detailed UI requests like dynamic dropdowns for locations/categories, and systematically debug issues. The most recent interactions involved fixing various UI functionality issues and performance bottlenecks, leading to a stable core application. The user has just provided an extensive new set of requirements for a comprehensive AI stack integration, and the immediate task is to address a persistent Add Lead form error before tackling this new large-scale integration.

The goal is to build a green-themed, all-in-one CRM + ERP + HRMS + Telephony + AI Assistant for Aavana Greens, supporting Web, Mobile & PWA, to replace multiple existing systems. Core features include:
- **Telephony**: Shared business number, IVR, call routing, recording, number masking, AI caller tunes.
- **WhatsApp CRM**: Official API, auto-replies, chatbot lead filter, smart suggestions, active chat panel, voice task assignment.
- **Sales & Task Management**: Dashboard (leads, revenue, conversion), pipeline tracking, lead addition (name, phone, notes, tags, assignment), AI breakdown of voice tasks.
- **HRMS**: Smart attendance (face + location), GPS check-in/out, auto salary calculation, leave management, admin adjustments.
- **AI Engine**: Memory layer for client history, AI insights panel, AI content generation (social posts, ads, blogs), voice-to-task, photo analysis for product suggestions.
- **Appointments & Location**: Booking link, Google Calendar sync, auto-reminders, GPS site visit capture.
- **ERP & Data**: Lead sync from external platforms, product catalog (name, price, stock, category, barcode scan, Excel import), project gallery/portfolio.
- **Analytics & Admin**: Metrics, PDF/Excel reports, role-based access (Super Admin, Admin, Sales, Design, Inside Sales), monthly performance popups.
- **Hybrid AI Approach (User Specified)**: GPT-5 (primary engine), Claude Sonnet 4 (memory/knowledge layer), Gemini 2.5 Pro (multimodal workflows), with an orchestration layer (Emergent LLM key, LangChain, LlamaIndex).
- **Recent Additions**: Lead source & category fields, comprehensive Indian city/state selection for location, a Super Admin Panel, and a global AI Chat interface.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**: Main FastAPI application entry point. It orchestrates API routes, handles dependencies, CORS, and integrates various services. It has been modified extensively to include routes for CRM (leads, tasks), AI features, Telephony, WhatsApp, HRMS, ERP, and Calendar.
-   **/app/backend/ai_service.py**: This file houses the logic for AI-powered features, including voice-to-task breakdown, AI insights generation, and AI content creation, utilizing  with GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro.
-   **/app/backend/{telephony,whatsapp,hrms,erp,calendar}_service.py**: These are newly created files, each encapsulating the business logic and API endpoints for their respective domains (Telephony, WhatsApp CRM, HRMS, ERP, Appointments/Calendar). They interact with MongoDB and other potential external services.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main React component. This file acts as the central hub for the frontend, handling routing, global state management (leads, tasks, products, employees, etc.), data fetching, and rendering all major UI components and tabs. It has been heavily modified to include all dashboard elements, lead management forms (with dynamic location/category dropdowns), sales pipeline, task manager, AI assistant, ERP, HRMS, and Admin tabs, as well as the floating AI chat interface. It also includes error handling for API calls and manages loading states.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**: Global CSS for the application, primarily using Tailwind CSS for styling. It defines the green theme, responsive design elements, and general UI/UX.
-   **/app/frontend/src/data/indianCitiesStates.js**: A newly created JavaScript file containing an extensive list of Indian states and cities, used to populate dropdowns in the frontend forms (e.g., Add Lead).
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/ui/**: Contains a rich library of Shadcn UI components (buttons, dialogs, forms, inputs, selects, tabs, etc.) which are used throughout the application for a consistent and modern UI/UX.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Integrate the comprehensive new AI stack across all application features as detailed by the user (Conversational CRM, Sales & Pipeline, Marketing & Growth, Product/Project/Gallery, Analytics & Admin, HR & Team Ops, Admin & Roles, Automation Layer).
- Specifically fix the Add Lead form errors, particularly the ResizeObserver loop completed with undelivered notifications issue.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of debugging and fixing multiple reported issues in the application. The primary concern was that several critical buttons (Add Product, Create Invoice, Add Project, HRMS functions like Face check-in, GPS check-in, Process, Apply Leaves) were not working, and the user also inquired about a global AI chat option for marketing.

The engineer systematically addressed these:
1.  **Backend AI Call Performance**: Identified that LiteLLM calls to GPT-5 were occasionally hanging, causing backend timeouts and frontend loading issues. This was temporarily resolved by restarting the backend.
2.  **Missing Functionality for Buttons**: The engineer realized many buttons in the UI lacked corresponding implemented functions or dialog forms. New dialog forms for Add Product, Create Invoice, and Add Project were implemented and integrated into the ERP tab. HRMS buttons (Face Check-In, GPS Check-In, Process, Apply Leaves) were connected to their respective functions.
3.  **Global AI Chat**: A floating AI chat interface was added to the main application to provide universal AI assistance.

After these fixes, the application's core functionality, including dashboard loading, navigation, ERP, HRMS, and AI features, seemed operational. However, the user reported that the Add Lead form still had errors. Upon further inspection, the AI identified specific JavaScript runtime errors: ResizeObserver loop completed with undelivered notifications, which are causing the Add Lead form to malfunction. This is the immediate and most critical issue currently being addressed.
