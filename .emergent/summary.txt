The AI engineer successfully transitioned the Aavana Greens application from MVP to a feature-rich system, addressing numerous bugs and implementing substantial new functionalities. Initial work focused on critical UI stabilization, including a  and a z-index issue. Subsequently, the engineer systematically implemented multi-file uploads, voice-to-text, role/department management, lead actions, face check-in, and offline autosave. This involved creating new backend services and numerous React components, extensively modifying .

Persistent frontend loading issues, initially due to incorrect backend URL and later  conflicts, were debugged and resolved. The  backend dependency was also addressed multiple times. Major development included creating backend services for lead routing and GPT-5 workflow authoring, along with corresponding frontend components. The engineer also extensively debugged and fixed JavaScript runtime errors (e.g.,  issues, undefined property access) and critical JSX syntax errors that were preventing the application from compiling and tabs from navigating correctly.

Towards the end, the engineer implemented exclusive panel display logic for the Admin section, added camera capture to file uploads, and a comprehensive catalog management system. The trajectory concludes with the engineer addressing a new bug report by adding mock data for leads, tasks, and role management, and initiating an overhaul of the Face Check-in component for a permanent fix, as requested by the user due to recurring issues.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in addressing critical bug reports related to data display and core functionalities. The , , and  pages were reported as blank due to failing API calls. To quickly resolve the display issues, mock data was added to  for both leads and tasks. The  had previously been fixed to display with fallback data.

The  tab was also reported as empty, which was addressed by modifying  to display mock role and permission data.

The most critical and recurring issue,  functionality, was reported as still not working across all devices. The AI engineer has just initiated a complete overhaul of the  to ensure a permanent fix for camera access and image capture, as explicitly requested by the user, who emphasized that this feature must be permanently fixed before any further charges are incurred.
