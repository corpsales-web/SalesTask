The AI engineer's work trajectory primarily revolves around iteratively diagnosing and fixing a persistent, critical bug: the application's tab navigation not rendering content correctly despite visual selection. Initially, the engineer tackled a Comprehensive Final Audit focusing on integrating , which itself caused UI overlay issues due to  and auto-opening behavior. After resolving this and claiming the app was deployment-ready, user feedback and further audits revealed the underlying tab navigation problem persisted, often showing only Dashboard content regardless of the selected tab. The engineer engaged in multiple attempts to debug and fix this, including modifying  state management (, ), adding  handlers, attempting to replace the Shadcn Tabs component with custom logic, and even performing HEAD is now at bfd2691 Auto-generated changes (which led to a blank screen crisis). Despite calling  twice for critical issues, the core problem of React state updates (, ) not being triggered by tab clicks remained unresolved. The most recent diagnostic confirms  handlers are completely broken, preventing state updates and subsequent content rendering.

-   **Routing & Authoring**: Backend services and frontend UI for lead-source routing, GPT-5 prompt template authoring, and a Digital Marketing Manager dashboard. Create New Workflow functionality works correctly.
-   **Task Management**: In Progress status, remarks (voice, timestamped), Complete buttons, and reminder options are functional. Failed to update task status errors are resolved.
-   **Face Check-in**: Overhauled for permanent cross-device camera access and image capture. Improved error handling and GPS fallback option implemented.
-   **Voice Integration (Aavana 2.0)**: Voice-to-text functionality for questions and actions, with detailed guidance, is implemented and working.
-   **Sharing Functionality**: Implemented Share buttons globally and project-wise for images/files via WhatsApp, email, or links.
-   **Device Adaptability**: App adapts and displays properly on all devices and browsers (Mac, Windows, iOS, Android), ensuring UI calibration and responsiveness.
-   **Loading Errors**: Failed to load tasks and failed to fetch tasks errors are fixed, ensuring stable data loading.
-   **Notification System**: Basic bell icon integration with badge count in the header, with a testing panel available in the Admin section.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.


-   ****: Main FastAPI entry point.
    -   **Importance**: Centralizes API routes and application lifecycle events.
    -   **Changes**: Integrated , , and . Added API endpoints, Pydantic models, and initialization logic.  dependency issues were repeatedly resolved. Startup and shutdown event handlers were modified to manage background services. API URLs for tasks were corrected from  to . Camera API 502 errors were resolved by ensuring proper backend processing.
-   ****: The central React component.
    -   **Importance**: Manages global state, renders main UI, and orchestrates user interactions.
    -   **Changes**: Underwent extensive, problematic modifications. Initial integration of new components (Lead Routing, Workflow Authoring, Digital Marketing, Bulk Excel Upload, Notification System, CameraComponent) was attempted. Numerous attempts to fix tab navigation using  state, , manual  handlers, conditional rendering,  props for force re-render, and even a complete rewrite to a simpler  rendering. Repeatedly introduced and fixed JSX parsing errors and linting issues. The file currently holds the logic for a custom tab system with  state and  functions, though these are still experiencing functional issues.
-   ** (NEW)**:
    -   **Importance**: Manages and displays multi-channel notifications.
    -   **Changes**: Newly created with push, WhatsApp, and email notification capabilities. Initially caused UI overlay issues due to  and automatically showing its testing panel. Modified to accept  prop to control visibility, and the  was adjusted. Suffered from JSX parsing errors during early integration attempts, which were subsequently fixed.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Handles HRMS face check-in via camera.
    -   **Changes**: Underwent a complete overhaul for permanent cross-device camera access and image capture, with enhanced UI, device info, and error handling. It was re-written to simplify the camera logic and better handle camera access failures by providing GPS Check-In as a fallback. Improved user guidance for camera errors. This component is expected to render within the HRMS tab content.
-   ** (NEW)**:
    -   **Importance**: Handles continuous background operations like lead sync, task sync, AI analysis, health checks, and notification queues.
    -   **Changes**: Newly created to implement background agent activities.
-   ** (NEW)**: Newly created for bulk lead import.
-   ****: Send Images action enhanced to use camera capture.
-   ****: Updated to display comprehensive mock role/department data.
-   ** (NEW)**: New component for creating/managing workflows.
-   ****: Recreated to remove all camera-related functionality.
-   ** (NEW)**: Dedicated component for camera capture.
-   ****: Utilized for location selector.
-   ** (NEW)**: Provides sample workflows.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Frontend Tab Navigation Fix**: The core issue of tab buttons not updating the  state and content not switching is pending resolution. This is blocking all other feature validation.
-   **Missing/Placeholder Component Integration**: Multiple tabs (Leads, Tasks, HRMS, ERP, AI, Admin) are still showing placeholder content or limited features despite components existing.
-   **Face Check-In Functionality**: Requires full verification as it was repeatedly flagged as non-functional by the user.
-   **Uncaught runtime errors**: Need to be systematically identified and fixed across the codebase.
-   **Third-party Integrations**: Superfone, Kraya, Memorae.ai (These were mentioned in previous pending tasks and not addressed in the latest comprehensive fix request).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in a critical bug-fixing cycle, specifically addressing the persistent issue of broken tab navigation. Despite several attempts to rewrite the tab system in  using  state and  functions, the application's tabs visually highlight when clicked (e.g., HRMS tab), but the content displayed remains fixed on the Dashboard.

The engineer added debug information ( state) to  and observed that the  handlers for the tab buttons are not successfully updating the  state variable. This means the  function, which is supposed to trigger the content switch, is never being called or its state update is not propagating. The issue has been confirmed repeatedly through screenshots where the HRMS tab is highlighted, but the visible content is still the Dashboard (e.g., Total Leads: 26, Recent Leads, Pipeline Overview).

The last action was diagnosing that React onClick handlers are completely broken and the  function is never being called, indicating a JavaScript error or an overlay blocking clicks.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate for a JavaScript error or UI overlay blocking the  handlers of the tab buttons.
