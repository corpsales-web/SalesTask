The AI engineer systematically addressed a complex set of product requirements and bug fixes for the Aavana Greens application, extending it from an MVP. Initial efforts focused on UI stability and critical bug resolution ( errors,  dependency). Subsequently, the engineer implemented significant features: multi-file uploads with camera capture, voice-to-text, robust role/department management, lead actions, a comprehensive catalog management system, and an overhaul of Face Check-in. Numerous JavaScript runtime errors and JSX compilation issues were identified and resolved, often iteratively. The engineer then tackled backend connectivity, implemented a sophisticated bulk Excel upload system, established a comprehensive testing infrastructure (unit, E2E, CI/CD), integrated a multi-channel notification system, and developed background agent services. The most recent focus involved fixing task management (start button, complete/reminder options) and refining gallery/lead camera uploads. The work highlights an iterative approach to development, meticulous debugging, and sequential task completion.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing two critical UI and functionality issues related to **Upload & Gallery**.

First, in the **ERP Project Gallery**, the requirement was to add a *separate camera button* for gallery uploads, distinct from the generic Upload Files button. This was implemented by adding a new camera button in  alongside the existing upload functionality in the Project Gallery section (around lines 4173-4183 of the JSX).

Second, in the **Leads section**, the generic Upload Files button needed to be made *lead-specific*, especially for the Images action button on individual lead cards. The engineer located the  component and modified the Send Images action. This involved enhancing the action definition and replacing the generic file upload logic with camera-specific capture functionality within the 's action modal. The build completed successfully, indicating the code changes were syntactically correct.

The most recent action was to test these enhanced Upload & Gallery functionalities via a screenshot tool. The screenshot confirmed the presence of the separate camera button in the ERP Project Gallery and the general file upload modal with camera capture. However, the lead-specific camera functionality within the Images action button on individual lead cards still needs to be explicitly verified.

<optional_next_step>
Test the lead-specific camera functionality within the Images action button.

I notice the lead-specific camera buttons might be in the Images action that needs to be clicked. Let me check that the lead action has been properly updated by testing one of the Images buttons:
