## Testing Your Workflows

### 1. Using the Test Feature
- Click **"Test Workflow"** in the Workflow Builder
- Provide sample data like:
  ```json
  {
    "lead_name": "Rajesh Kumar",
    "project_type": "Residential Garden",
    "budget": "â‚¹2,50,000",
    "location": "Mumbai",
    "phone": "+91 9876543210",
    "email": "rajesh@example.com"
  }
  ```

### 2. Monitor Test Results
- Check the **Testing & Analytics** tab
- Review AI responses, token usage, and execution time
- Verify all steps execute correctly

### 3. Publish When Ready
- Click **"Publish"** to make the workflow live
- Set up triggers (new leads, project completion, etc.)
- Monitor performance in Analytics

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Workflow Design
- Start simple with 3-5 steps
- Add complexity gradually
- Always include conditional logic for different scenarios
- Set appropriate timeouts and reminders

### 2. AI Prompts
- Be specific about desired output format
- Include relevant context variables
- Test with various input scenarios
- Use appropriate AI models (GPT-5 for creativity, Claude for analysis)

### 3. Message Templates
- Keep messages conversational and personal
- Include clear call-to-actions
- Use emojis sparingly but effectively
- Test across different communication channels

### 4. Error Handling
- Always enable "Retry on failure"
- Set reasonable timeout values
- Include fallback paths for failed conditions
- Monitor workflow execution logs

---

## Troubleshooting
